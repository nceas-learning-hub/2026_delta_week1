Manuscripts are edited. Figures get revised. Code gets fixed when bugs are discovered. Sometimes those fixes lead to even more bugs, leading to more changes in the code base. Data files get combined. Those same files are split and combined again. In just one research project, we can expect thousands of changes!\n\nThese changes are important to track, and yet, we often use simplistic file names to do so. Many of us have experienced renaming a document or script multiple times with the disingenuous addition of \"final\" to the file name.\n\nA better way: **version control**\n\nVersion control provides an organized and transparent way to track changes in code and files. This practice was designed for software development, but is easily applicable to scientific programming.\n\nBenefits to using a version control software include:\n\n-   **Maintain a history** of project development while keeping your workspace clean\n-   **Facilitate collaboration** and transparency when working on teams\n-   **Explore bugs or new features** without disrupting your team's work\n-   and more!\n\nThe version control system we'll be diving into is Git, the most widely used modern version control system in the world.\n\n## Introduction to Git + GitHub\n\nLet's start with a motivating example that's representative of the types of problems Git can help us solve.\n\n[Full Screen](slides/github_introduction/slides1_motivating_example.html)\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"slides/github_introduction/slides1_motivating_example.html\" style=\"border: 1px solid #2e3846;\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n#### With Git we can enhance our workflow: {.unnumbered}\n\n- **Eliminate** the need for **cryptic filenames** and comments to track our work.\n- Provide **detailed descriptions of our changes** through commits, making it easier to understand the reasons behind code modifications.\n- Work on multiple **branches** simultaneously, allowing for parallel development, and optionally merge them together.\n- Use commits to **access and even execute older versions** of our code.\n- **Assign meaningful tags** to specific versions of our code.\n- **Multiple individuals can work on the same analysis concurrently** on their own computers, with the ability to merge everyone's changes together.\n\n### What exactly are Git and GitHub?\n\n#### Git: an open-source **version control** software {.unnumbered}\n\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/git-intro.png\" alt=\"Cartoon of a desktop computer containing the Git logo\" width=\"30%\" align=\"right\"/>\n\n-  designed to manage the versioning and tracking of files and project history\n-  **operates locally** on your computer, allowing you to create repositories and track changes\n-  provides features such as committing changes, branching and merging code, reverting to previous versions, and managing project history\n-  works directly with the files on your computer and does not require a network connection for most operations\n- primarily used through the command-line interface (CLI, e.g. Terminal), but also has various GUI tools available (e.g. Positron IDE)\n\n#### GitHub: an **online platform** and service built around Git {.unnumbered}\n\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/github-intro.png\" alt=\"Cartoon of a cloud labeled 'GitHub' with the GitHub logo\" width=\"30%\" align=\"right\"/>\n\n-  provides a **centralized hosting platform for Git repositories**\n-  allows us to store, manage, and collaborate on Git repositories in the cloud\n-  offers additional features on top of Git, including a web-based interface, issue tracking, project management tools, pull requests, code review, and collaboration features\n-  enables easy sharing of code with others, facilitating collaboration and contribution to open source projects\n-  provides a social aspect, allowing users to follow projects, star repositories, and discover new code\n\n### How local files, Git, and GitHub work together\n\nIt can be daunting to understand the moving parts of the Git / GitHub life cycle (i.e. how file changes are tracked locally within repositories, then stored for safe-keeping and collaboration on remote repositories, then brought back down to a local machine(s) for continued development). It gets easier with practice, but here's a high-level overview of how things work:\n\n#### What is the difference between a \"normal\" folder vs. a Git repository?\n\nLet's pretend that we create a folder, called `myFolder/`, and add two files: `myData.csv` and `myAnalysis.R`. The contents of this folder are not currently version-controlled -- meaning, for example, that if we make changes to `myAnalysis.R` that don't work out, we have no way of accessing or reverting back to a previous version of `myAnalysis.R` (without remembering or rewriting things, of course).\n\nGit allows you to turn any \"normal\" folder, like `myFolder/`, into a **Git repository** -- this is often referenced as \"initializing a Git repository\". When you initialize a folder on your local computer as a Git repository, a hidden `.git/` folder is created *within* that folder (e.g. `myFolder/.git/`). This `.git/` folder *is* the **Git repository**. \n\nAs you use Git commands to capture versions or \"snapshots\" of your work, those versions (and their associated metadata) get stored within the `.git/` folder. This allows you to access and/or recover any previous versions of your work. If you delete `.git/`, you delete your project's history.\n\nHere is our example folder / Git repository represented visually:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/git-repo.png\" alt=\"Diagram of a local Git repository with a CSV, R script, and '.git' folder in the project directory\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</p>\n\n#### How do I tell Git to preserve versions of my local working files?\n\nGit was built as a command-line tool, meaning we can use Git commands in the command line (e.g. Terminal, Git Bash, etc.) to take \"snapshots\" of our local working files. Alternatively, Positron provides buttons that easily execute these Git commands.\n\nGenerally, that workflow looks something like this:\n\n- Make changes to a file(s) (e.g. `myAnalysis.R`) in your working directory.\n- Stage the file(s) using `git add myAnalysis.R` (or `git add .` to stage multiple changed files at once). This lets Git know that you'd like to include the file(s) in your next commit.\n- Commit the file(s) using `git commit -m \"a message describing my changes\"`. This records those changes (along with a descriptive message) as a \"snapshot\" or version in the local repository (i.e. the `.git/` folder).\n\n#### How do I send work from my local computer to GitHub?\n\nThe last step is synchronizing the changes made to our local repository with a remote repository (this remote repository is often stored on GitHub). The `git push` command is used to send local commits up to a remote repository. The `git pull` command is used to fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into the local repository -- **pull**ing will become a regular part of your workflow when collaborating with others, or even when working alone but on different machines (e.g. a laptop at home and a desktop at the office).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/allison-horst-git-workflow.png\" alt=\"A basic Git workflow represented as two islands, one with 'local repo' and 'working directory', and another with 'remote repo.' Bunnies move file boxes from the working directory to the staging area, then with Commit move them to the local repo. Bunnies in rowboats move changes from the local repo to the remote repo (labeled 'PUSH') and from the remote repo to the working directory (labeled PULL')\" width=\"90%\"/>\n<figcaption>Artwork by Allison Horst</figcaption>\n</p>\n\n### Let's Look at a GitHub Repository\n\nThis screen shows the copy of a repository stored on GitHub, with its list of files, when the files and directories were last modified, and some information on who made the most recent changes.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/gh-repo_home.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of a GitHub repository's landing page\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</p>\n\nIf we drill into the \"commits\" for the repository (by clicking the \"Commits\" button just beneath the colored \"Code\" dropdown menu), we can see the history of changes made to all of the files. Looks like `kellijohnson` was working on the project and fixing errors in December:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/gh-repo_commits.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of a GitHub repository's page showing the history of the commits in the repository\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</p>\n\nAnd finally, if we drill into a particular commit, we can see exactly what was changed in each file that was included in that commit:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/gh-repo_diff.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of a GitHub repository's page showing the 'diff' of files edited in a particular commit\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</p>\n\nTracking these changes, how they relate to released versions of software and files is exactly what Git and GitHub are good for. And we will show how they can really be effective for tracking versions of scientific code, figures, and manuscripts to accomplish a reproducible workflow.\n\n### Git Vocabulary & Commands\n\nWe know the world of Git and GitHub can be daunting. Use these tables as references while you use Git and GitHub, and we encourage you to build upon this list as you become more comfortable with these tools.\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n#### Essential Git Commands \n\nThis table contains essential terms and commands that complement intro to Git skills. They will get you far on personal and individual projects.\n\n| Term | Git Command(s) | Definition |\n|:---:|:-----|:-------------------------|\n| Add/Stage | `git add [file]` | Staging marks a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot. You can also stage all modified files at the same time using `git add .` |\n| Commit | `git commit` | Records changes to the repository |\n| Commit Message | `git commit -m \"my commit message\"` | Records changes to the repository and include a descriptive message (you should always include a commit message!) |\n| Fetch | `git fetch` | Retrieves changes from a remote repository but does not merge them into your local working file(s). |\n| Pull | `git pull` | Retrieves changes from a remote repository _and_ merges them into your local working file(s) |\n| Push | `git push` | Sends local commits to a remote repository |\n| Status | `git status` | Shows the current status of the repository, including (un)staged files and branch information |\n\n#### Advanced Git Commands\n\nThis table includes more advanced Git terms and commands that are commonly used in both individual and collaborative projects.\n\n Term | Git Command(s) | Definition |\n|:---:|:-----|:-------------------------|\n| Branch | `git branch` | Lists existing branches or creates a new branch |\n| Checkout | `git checkout [branch]` | Switches to a different branch or restores files from a specific commit |\n| Clone | `git clone [repository]` | Creates a local copy of a remote repository |\n| Diff | `git diff` | Shows differences between files, commits, or branches |\n| Log | `git log` | Displays the commit history of the repository |\n| Merge | `git merge [branch]` | Integrates changes from one branch into another branch |\n| Rebase | `git rebase` | Integrates changes from one branch onto another by modifying commit history |\n| Remote | `git remote` | Manages remote repositories linked to the local repository |\n| Repository | `git init` | A directory where Git tracks and manages files and their versions |\n| Stash | `git stash` | Temporarily saves changes that are not ready to be committed |\n| Tag | `git tag` | Assigns a label or tag to a specific commit |\n\nGit has a rich set of commands and features, and there are many more terms beyond either table. Learn more by visiting the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs).\n\n#### GitHub Terms\n\nThis table includes terms for which there are not specific Git commands.\n\n Term | Definition |\n|:---:|:-------------------------|\n| Fork  | Creates a personal copy of a repository under your GitHub account for independent development |\n| Merge Conflict | Occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches, requiring manual resolution |\n| Pull Request (PR) | A request to merge changes from a branch into another branch, typically in a collaborative project |\n\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 1: Create a remote repository on GitHub\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Setup\n\n1.  Login to [GitHub](https://github.com/)\n2.  Click the **New repository** button\n3.  Name it `{FIRSTNAME}_test`\n4.  Add a short description\n5.  Check the box to add a `README.md` file\n6.  Add a `.gitignore` file using the `R` template\n7.  Set the `LICENSE` to Apache 2.0\n:::\n\nIf you were successful, it should look something like this:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/new-repo_p1.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of the top half of the page on GitHub that allows a user to create a new repository\" width=\"80%\"/>\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/new-repo_p2.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of the bottom half of the page on GitHub that allows a user to create a new repository\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</p>\n\nYou've now created your first repository! It has a couple of files that GitHub created for you: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `.gitignore`. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## `README.md` files are used to share important information about your repository\nYou should always add a `README.md` to the root directory of your repository -- it is a markdown file that is rendered as HTML and displayed on the landing page of your repository. This is a common place to include any pertinent information about what your repository contains, how to use it, etc.\n:::\n\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/new-repo_home.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of the main landing page for a brand new GitHub repository\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nFor simple changes to text files, such as the `README.md`, you can make edits directly in the GitHub web interface.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Challenge\n\nNavigate to the `README.md` file in the file listing, and edit it by clicking on the **pencil icon** (top right of file). This is a regular Markdown file, so you can add markdown text. Add a new level-2 header called \"Purpose\" and add some bullet points describing the purpose of the repo. When done, add a commit message, and hit the **Commit changes** button.\n:::\n\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/new-repo_test-edit.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of the page in GitHub that appears when you edit a file in a repository directly through GitHub's web interface\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nCongratulations, you've now authored your first versioned commit! If you navigate back to the GitHub page for the repository, you'll see your commit listed there, as well as the rendered `README.md` file.\n\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/new-repo_test-displayed.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of the landing page of a GitHub repository after the README has been edited to include non-template content\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nThe GitHub repository landing page provides us with lots of useful information. To start, we see: \n\n- all of the files in the remote repository\n- when each file was last edited\n- the commit message that was included with each file's most recent commit (which is why it's important to write good, descriptive commit messages!)\n\nAdditionally, the header above the file listing shows the most recent commit, along with its commit message, and a unique ID (assigned by Git) called a [SHA](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits#about-commits). The SHA (aka hash) identifies the specific changes made, when they were made, and by who. If you click on the SHA, it will display the set of changes made in that particular commit.\n\n::: {.callout-caution icon=false}\n## What should I write in my commit message?\n\nWriting effective Git commit messages is essential for creating a meaningful and helpful version history in your repository. It is crucial to avoid skipping commit messages or resorting to generic phrases like \"Updates.\" When it comes to following best practices, there are several guidelines to enhance the readability and maintainability of the codebase.\n\nHere are some guidelines for writing effective Git commit messages:\n\n1. **Be descriptive and concise**: Provide a clear and concise summary of the changes made in the commit. Aim to convey the purpose and impact of the commit in a few words.\n\n2. **Use imperative tense**: Write commit messages in the imperative tense, as if giving a command. For example, use \"Add feature\" instead of \"Added feature\" or \"Adding feature.\" This convention aligns with other Git commands and makes the messages more actionable.\n\n3. **Separate subject and body**: Start with a subject line, followed by a blank line, and then provide a more detailed explanation in the body if necessary. The subject line should be a short, one-line summary, while the body can provide additional context, motivation, or details about the changes.\n\n4. **Limit the subject line length**: Keep the subject line within 50 characters or less. This ensures that the commit messages are easily scannable and fit well in tools like Git logs.\n\n5. **Capitalize and punctuate properly**: Begin the subject line with a capital letter and use proper punctuation. This adds clarity and consistency to the commit messages.\n\n6. **Focus on the \"what\" and \"why\"**: Explain what changes were made and why they were made. Understanding the motivation behind a commit helps future researchers and collaborators (including you!) comprehend its purpose.\n\n7. **Use present tense for subject, past tense for body**: Write the subject line in present tense as it represents the current state of the codebase. Use past tense in the body to describe what has been done.\n\n8. **Reference relevant issues**: If the commit is related to a specific issue or task, include a reference to it. For example, you can mention the issue number or use keywords like \"Fixes,\" \"Closes,\" or \"Resolves\" followed by the issue number.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 2: Clone Your Repository with Positron\n\nCurrently, our repository just exists on GitHub as a remote repository. It's easy enough to make changes to things like our `README.md` file (as demonstrated above), from the web browser, but that becomes a lot harder (and discouraged) for scripts and other code files. In this exercise, we'll bring a copy of this remote repository down to our local computer (aka **clone** this repository) so that we can work comfortably in Positron.\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"An important distinction\"}\nWe refer to the **remote copy** of the repository that is on GitHub as the **origin repository** (the one that we cloned from), and the copy on our local computer as the **local repository**.\n:::\n\nPositron makes working with Git and version controlled files easy -- to do so, you'll need to tell Positron the folder in which you want it to clone your origin repository. For RStudio users, the following steps will look similar to the process of making an R Project, albeit very streamlined.\n\n### Cloning a Repository\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Positron Clone Process\n\n1. Start by copying the link to your GitHub repository from the address bar of your web browser\n    - Should be something like \"https://github.com/`github-username`/`repository-name`\"\n2. Click the folder icon in the top right corner of Positron\n3. Select **New Folder from Git...**\n4. In the **Git repository URL** field, paste in the link you copied in step 1\n5. Choose which folder you want to clone this repository to\n    - We recommend _not_ cloning into a local sync of a cloud storage service (e.g., OneDrive, Dropbox) as that service's form of version control and Git's may cause problems for you\n6. Click OK\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/new-repo_clone-dialog-positron.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron's dialogue menu for cloning a new repository from GitHub\" width=\"65%\"/>\n</p>\n:::\n\nOnce you click **OK**, your Positron window will refresh and the \"Explorer\" tab (in the left sidebar) will show that all files from the remote repository have been copied locally. Note that the folder icon in the top right corner will now have the name of your repository from GitHub.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/new-repo_clone-positron.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron after successfully cloning a new repository from GitHub\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</p>\n\nIf you click the \"Source Control\" tab (its symbol looks like this: {{< fa code-branch >}}) you will see that there are no changes because we haven't done anything to the local copy yet! However, both the commits (the initial commit and the test edit made directly in GitHub) are shown in the bottom left corner in reverse chronological order (i.e., most recent at the top).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/new-repo_source-control_no-changes.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron's 'source control' pane after cloning a new repository from GitHub before editing it\" width=\"60%\"/>\n</p>\n\nWe can actually interact with particular commits to get more detailed information on what was changed directly through Positron! Click the top commit to expand it and see the files that were changed as part of that commit. Now click the README file (the only one edited as part of that commit). A file will now open in the main window of Positron showing the README file with new lines highlighted in green and deleted lines highlighted in red.\n\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/new-repo_source-control_diff-history.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron's 'source control' pane with the 'diff' of the README from a particular commit opened\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n### Making a Commit\n\nNow that we have seen the changes from the past, let's go ahead and make some new changes in Positron. Close the diff file we had open then click back to the \"File Explorer\" tab and double click the README file to open it. While adding the purpose statement was nice addition, the top of the README is still looking very template-y, let's customize it a bit.\n\nGo ahead and give the README a more informative title (that's the text after a single `#`) and expand the first line of the description to add some more context. After you've done this your README should look something like the following.\n\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/positron-commit_01-edit.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron with the README file opened and Git it is flagging it as having been modified\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nNote that once you edit and save the README, the file's name (both in the Explorer tab list and in the top of Positron) will turn orange and have a capital \"M\" to the right of the filename. This is Git letting you know that the file has been modified from the most recent version. Additionally, the Source Control tab will get a red circle with a \"1,\" indicating that the state of one file in the version controlled repository has changed.\n\nIf you head over to the Source Control tab, you'll see that the README now appears under the \"Changes\" list.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/positron-commit_02-source-control.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron's 'source control' tab with the README file listed under the 'changes' heading\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\nOnce you are there, **hover your mouse over the README and a plus sign button will appear, click it.** Note that the button is not visible unless your mouse is over some part of the \"Changes\" list. _Clicking that button is analogous to using the Git command, `git add README.md`, in the command line._\n\nAfter you click the plus sign, the README will move under a new list titled \"Staged Changes\". You can now add a commit message and then click the \"Commit\" button when you're ready to do so. _This is analogous to using the Git command, `git commit -m \"my commit message\"`, in the command line._\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/positron-commit_03-stage.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron's 'source control' tab with the README file listed under the 'staged changes' heading and an informative commit message in the respective text field\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\nOnce you do that, a few things will happen simultaneously:\n\n- The \"Commit\" button will automatically change into a \"Sync Changes\" button.\n- Both the \"Changes\" and \"Staged Changes\" lists will disappear\n- The README file tab will go back to the default color and the \"M\" next to it will vanish\n- The commit history diagram in the bottom left corner will show your new commit (in a different color than the prior commits)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/positron-commit_04-commit.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron's 'source control' tab with the README file listed under the 'changes' heading\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\nGo ahead and click the Sync button. It will become a grayed-out Commit button again and your commit history (bottom left) will go back to all being one color as the commit that was previously only on your local repository is synced with the remote repository.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/positron-commit_05-sync.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron's 'source control' tab where no files are showing as changed or staged\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\nIf you navigate back to your remote repository on GitHub, you should see the edits to your README and the most recent commit will be the one you just made. Note that sometimes you have to refresh the page or wait a few seconds for those updates to be visible on GitHub.\n\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/positron-commit_06-updated-remote.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of a GitHub repository's landing page with a new commit\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n::: callout-note\n## Challenge\n\n1.  Make a change to the `README.md` file -- this time from Positron -- then commit the `README.md` change\n2.  Add a new section to your `README.md` called \"Creator\" using a level-2 header. Under it include some information about yourself. **Bonus:** Add some contact information and link your email using Markdown syntax.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 3: Starting Git on an Existing Folder\n\nThere are a number of different workflows for creating version-controlled repositories that are stored on GitHub. We started with Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 using one common approach: create a remote repository on GitHub first, _then_ clone that repository to your local computer. However, you may find yourself in the situation where you **have an _existing_ folder of content that you want to _start_ tracking with Git and host in GitHub.**\n\nThere are a few approaches for connecting an existing local folder to Git/GitHub but we'll focus on how you can do this via the command line. This has the advantage of being both coding language agnostic and IDE software agnostic. \n\nWhile the tutorial below will be using the Terminal in Positron, you could use any command-line interface (e.g. Mac Terminal, Git Bash, etc.) that allows for Git interactions. The advantage of Positron (and comparable IDEs) is that the Terminal is already 'looking' at your working directory while other command line interfaces would require you to navigate to the project directory (i.e., by using the `cd` command).\n\n### Open the Folder in Positron\n\nIn this last exercise, we will practice this workflow using your `training_{USERNAME}` folder. Switch to your `training_{USERNAME}` folder using the Positron folder dropdown menu. The folder dropdown menu is in the upper right corner of Positron. Click the dropdown next to your current folder name (`{FIRSTNAME}_test`), and then select `training_{USERNAME}` from the list of recent folders you've opened in Positron. If you've never opened the `training_{USERNAME}` folder with Positron, click **Open Folder...** instead and navigate to that folder.\n\nIn my case, I have some scripts that are empty but their names reflect steps in my code workflow that I think are likely enough to warrant making placeholder scripts. In the Explorer tab of Positron we can see those files are all just loose in the folder I'm using for this project.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/folder-first-git_01-folder.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron's 'explorer' tab with three files\" width=\"60%\"/>\n</p>\n\n### Start Git\n\nNow that we're in the right folder, **run `git init` <u>in the Terminal</u>**. This will return a message (also in the Terminal) saying something along the lines of `Initialized empty Git repository in...` followed by the absolute path to your chosen folder. Additionally, all the files listed in Positron's Explorer tab will turn green and get an uppercase \"U\" next to them for \"untracked.\"\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/folder-first-git_02-git-init.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron's 'explorer' tab with three files that are registering as untracked by Git\" width=\"60%\"/>\n</p>\n\n### Tell Git What to Ignore\n\nAn absolutely critical component of version control with Git is what Git _doesn't_ track, not just what it _does_ track. **Git repositories each use a file called \".gitignore\" to 'decide' what not to track.** This is useful for many reasons but in particular the .gitignore will be a useful guardrail against tracking (A) large files or (B) files with sensitive information (e.g., passwords, private data).\n\nAny file or folder named in the .gitignore won't show up in the Source Control of Positron (or its equivalents in other IDEs). This means that you don't need to carefully avoid accidentally staging/committing a sensitive/large file, you can just have that file automatically be ignored by Git. Also, if you ever change your mind and do want to start tracking a file you had previously ignored, just delete the name of that file from the .gitignore and the previously ignored file will become available for staging/committing!\n\nIn our earlier exercises, we've started repositories in GitHub with the template \".gitignore\" file for R users but when adding Git tracking to an existing folder, we'll need to add the \".gitignore\" manually. In the Terminal, follow the instructions below based on your computer's operating system\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n#### {{< fa brands apple >}} Mac / {{< fa brands linux >}} Linux\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntouch .gitignore # <1>\n```\n:::\n\n1. `touch` is command line for 'create this file'\n\n#### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncopy NUL .gitignore # <1>\n```\n:::\n\n1. This is command line for 'create this file'\n\nIf `copy NUL` does not work, try `touch` instead.\n\n:::\n\nOnce you've created a \".gitignore\" file, it will appear in Positron's Explorer tab and you can:\n\n1. Double click that file to open it\n2. Go to the GitHub repository you made for Exercise 2\n    - Likely `https://github.com/github-username/{firstname}_test`\n3. Click the .gitignore file in that repository\n4. Click the **Copy raw file** button \n    - Top right corner, just to the left of the pencil icon used to edit files directly in GitHub\n5. Return to the .gitignore in Positron\n6. Paste the contents of the `{firstname}_test` GitHub repository's .gitignore into the new .gitignore that you just created\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n#### .gitignore Templates\nThe .gitignore templates curated by GitHub are generally pretty good so copy/pasting that content will usually set you up for success. Note that as you work more with Git/GitHub, you may develop your own template for a .gitignore that ignores files or folders you consistently use across projects. In that case, feel free to copy that .gitignore's content instead of the generic GitHub template for your coding language.\n:::\n\nOnce you've done that, you should see the .gitignore register in Positron as another untracked file.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/folder-first-git_03-gitignore-content.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron's 'explorer' tab where an untracked '.gitignore' file is present\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</p>\n\n### Double Check Git's Status\n\nBecause we're using the Terminal inside of Positron, we have some helpful visuals to know that things have been going smoothly. However, if you were following these instructions outside of an IDE, you wouldn't have those handy <u>g</u>raphical <u>u</u>ser <u>i</u>nterface (GUI) elements.\n\nIn that case you would want to **run `git status` to make sure that the setup tasks you've taken so far are working as desired.** If everything is going smoothly, you should get a message like the following:\n\n```\nOn branch main\n\nNo commits yet\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n        .gitignore\n        01_wrangle.r\n        02_filter.r\n        03_analyze.r\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n```\n\n### Stage/Commit Your Files\n\nNow that we're confident Git is set up correctly, we want to start Git tracking on the files that are in our folder. In this case, because we want to track all the files, we can **run `git add .`** to stage all the files. If we only wanted to stage certain files, we could instead run `git add 01_harmonize.r` to stage one file at a time.\n\nWithout Positron's GUI, we could again run `git status` if we want to check whether staging worked as desired.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/folder-first-git_04-stage.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron's 'explorer' tab where all untracked files are staged\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</p>\n\nOnce we've staged the files that we want to be included in this first commit, we can **commit all staged files by running `git commit -m \"initial commit\"` in the Terminal.** Note that it's good practice to replace \"initial commit\" with something that is more informative and specific.\n\nOnce we've made that commit, Positron's GUI will remove the \"U\" next to all of the files that were commmitted (in this case, that's all of the files in the folder).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/folder-first-git_05-commit.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron's 'explorer' tab where all files are tracked by Git with no changes since the last commit\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</p>\n\nWithout an IDE, you can run `git log` in the Terminal to see a history of your past commits. Here's the log for this repository so far:\n\n```\ncommit 49245b6433ba49fedb46d09e737e7d239837e11c (HEAD -> main)\nAuthor: njlyon0 <{redacted}@gmail.com>\nDate:   Fri Feb 13 15:52:44 2026 -0500\n\n    feat: first commit of core scripts\n```\n### Connect Git and GitHub\n\nNow that we've got our local Git repository all nicely set up, it's time to lay the groundwork to get it talking with a remote repository hosted in GitHub. However, **there is an important difference between this GitHub repository and the ones we made earlier: <span style=\"color:red\"><u>it needs to be COMPLETELY EMPTY!</u></span>** \n\nIf you put anything in the GitHub repo when you make it, that counts as a commit. That means your local Git repository's first commit and the first commit of the remote GitHub repository are different and will create a horrible conflict that is a pain to fix. So, when you create this GitHub repository <u>**do not** include a README, .gitignore, or LICENSE file!</u>\n\nIf you create a completely empty GitHub repository the landing page will look something like the following:\n\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/folder-first-git_06-empty-gh-repo.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of a GitHub repository when it is created with nothing in it\" width=\"95%\">\n\nOnce you've made your <u>completely empty</u> GitHub repository:\n\n1. Scroll down to the **...or push an existing repository from the command line** section\n2. Copy the whole code chunk beneath that heading\n3. Run that code in Positron's Terminal\n\nAfter you've done that, if you refresh the page on the GitHub repository, you should see the files you just committed!\n\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/folder-first-git_07-gh-repo.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of a GitHub repository with a number of files added in a single commit\" width=\"100%\">\n\nSimilarly, your Positron Source Control tab will now look like it did in the previous exercises and will include the commit we made via the command line.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/github_introduction_positron/folder-first-git_08-positron.png\" alt=\"Screen capture of Positron's 'source control' tab with no files showing as being changed\" width=\"60%\"/>\n</p>\n\n::: {.callout-caution icon=false}\n## Challenge: Add a `README.md` file to `training_{USERNAME}`\n\nGitHub provides a button on your repo's landing page for quickly adding a `README.md` file. Click the **Add a README** button and use markdown syntax to create a `README.md`. Commit the changes to your repository.\n\nGo to your local repository and pull the changes you made.\n:::\n\n## Go Further With Git\n\nThere's a lot we haven't covered in this brief tutorial. There are some great and much longer tutorials that cover advanced topics, such as:\n\n- Resolving conflicts\n- Branching and merging\n- Pull requests versus direct contributions for collaboration\n- Using GitHub issues for collaborative project management\n\nand much, much more.\n\n## Git Resources\n\n- [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)\n- [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)\n- [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)\n- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) is an interactive tool to learn Git on the command line\n- [Software Carpentry Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)\n- Bitbucket's tutorials on [Git Workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)\n\n",
