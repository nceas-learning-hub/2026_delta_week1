## Overview

The [Delta Science Program](https://deltacouncil.ca.gov/delta-science-program/) is once again partnering with the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) (NCEAS) to convene a collaborative data synthesis working group in the spring of 2026. Delta Synthesis Working Groups receive advanced data science and statistics training with immediate opportunities to use those newly acquired skills to analyze available data and produce relevant research and data products. The upcoming working group will be the third cohort held through this partnership.
