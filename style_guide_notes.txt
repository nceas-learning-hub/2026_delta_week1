Style guide preferences:

* Snake case for file names and variable names
* Title case for headings and titles
    * This includes titles for callouts?
* Learning objectives:
    * For content driven lessons (most things) use verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy
        * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy#/media/File:Bloom%E2%80%99s_Taxonomy_Verbs.png
    * For setup lessons (just accomplish a task) OK to use more direct actions as verbs (e.g., set, configure, define)
